// This data structure was designed to support Proportional fonts

// using the conversion program. These could be fixed width or proportional 
// fonts. Individual characters do not have to be multiples of 8 bits wide. 
// Any width is fine and does not need to be fixed.

// The data bits are packed to minimize data requirements, but the tradeoff
// is that a header is required per character.
